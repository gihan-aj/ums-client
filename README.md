# User Management System (UMS)

A modern, full-stack User Management System built from the ground up to showcase best practices in both frontend and backend development. The frontend is a feature-rich Angular SPA, and the backend is a secure .NET Web API.

**Live Demo:** [[Deployed application](https://ums-client-200915304888.asia-south1.run.app/)]

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Full Authentication Flow:** Secure user registration, login, and password reset functionality using JWTs and HttpOnly refresh tokens.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
    - **Route-level security** using `CanActivateFn` guards to protect pages.
    - **UI-element security** with a custom `*appHasPermission` directive to declaratively show/hide buttons and menu items.
- **Complete CRUD Operations:** Fully-featured management pages for both Users and Roles.
- **Custom Component Library:** A complete set of reusable components built from scratch without any external libraries (like Angular Material or PrimeNG).
    - Generic Data Table with sorting and pagination.
    - Dynamic Modal & Dialog system.
    - Advanced `PermissionTree` custom form control.
    - Animated Dropdown menus.
- **Advanced State Management:** Utilizes NgRx for predictable global state, with lazy-loaded feature states for performance.
- **Responsive Design:** A clean, modern UI that works on any device, complete with a professional light/dark theme.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** A dynamic dashboard featuring charts (using Chart.js) and key metric cards.

## üöÄ Architectural Highlights

This project was built to demonstrate a deep understanding of modern web architecture. Key patterns include:

1.  **Hybrid State Management:** Uses NgRx for shared, global state (like auth) while leveraging component-level services for localized, complex state (like the multi-tab user edit form). This shows a pragmatic approach to state management.

2.  **Dynamic Component Injection:** The `DialogService` uses Angular's `ViewContainerRef` to dynamically create and destroy modal components at runtime, creating a powerful, decoupled UI system.

3.  **Declarative, Multi-Layered Security:** Combines route guards and a custom structural directive (`*appHasPermission`) to enforce authorization at both the page and element level.

4.  **Custom Form Controls with `ControlValueAccessor`:** Advanced components like the `PermissionTreeComponent` implement this interface, allowing them to integrate seamlessly with Angular's Reactive Forms.
